## Prerequisits üõ†Ô∏è
- [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (specifically [fzf-tmux](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#fzf-tmux-script))
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
- Optional: [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)


## Install üíª
Add this to your `.tmux.conf` and run `Ctrl-I` for TPM to install the plugin.
```conf
set -g @plugin 'omerxx/tmux-sessionx'
```

## Configure ‚öôÔ∏è
The default binding for this plugin is `<prefix>+O`
You can change it by adding this line with your desired key:
```bash
# I recommend using `o` if not already in use, for least key strokes when launching
set -g @sessionx-bind '<mykey>'
```
### Additional configuration options:
```bash
# `C-x` is a customizeable, by default it indexes directories in `$HOME/.config`, 
# but this can be changed by adding the config below.
# e.g. set -g @sessionx-x-path '~/dotfiles'
set -g @sessionx-x-path '<some-path>'

# A comma delimited absolute-paths list of custom paths 
# always visible in results and ready to create a session from. 
# Tip: if you're using zoxide mode, there's a good chance this is redundant
set -g @sessionx-custom-paths '/Users/me/projects,/Users/me/second-brain'

# By default, the current session will not be shown on first view
# This is to support quick switch of sessions
# Only after other actions (e.g. rename) will the current session appear
# Setting this option to 'false' changes this default behavior
set -g @sessionx-filter-current 'false' 

# Window mode can be turned on so that the default layout
# Has all the windows listed rather than sessions only
set -g @sessionx-window-mode 'on' 

# Preview location and screenspace can be adjusted with these
# Reminder: it can be toggeled on/off with `?`
set -g @sessionx-preview-location 'right'
set -g @sessionx-preview-ratio '55%'

# Change window dimensions
set -g @sessionx-window-height '90%'
set -g @sessionx-window-width '75%'

# When set to 'on' a non-result will be sent to zoxide for path matching
# Requires zoxide installed
set -g @sessionx-zoxide-mode 'on'
```

## Working with SessionX üë∑
Launching the plugin pops up an fzf-tmux "popup" with fizzy search over existing session (-current session).
If you insert a non-existing name and hit enter, a new session with that name will be created.
- `alt+backspace` will delete the selected session
- `C-u` scroll preview up
- `C-d` scroll preview down
- `C-r` will launch a `read` prompt to rename a session within the list
- `C-w` will reload the list with all the available *windows* and their preview
- `C-x` will fuzzy read `~/.config` or a configureable path of your choice (with `@session-x-path`)
- `C-e` will expand `PWD` and search for local directories to create additional session from
- `C-b` "back": reloads the first query. Useful when going into window or expand mode, to go back
- `?` toggles the preview pane


## WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è
This was only tested on one, macOs machine.
It is also not designed to use outside Tmux and is tailored to fit *my* needs.
That said, please feel free to open issues with bugs / additions you'd like to see.
